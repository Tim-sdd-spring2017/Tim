# Tim
  Many students and professionals struggle to keep all of their tasks organized and prioritized. The physical planner or digital calendar and PDA solutions have not evolved to take advantage of a data driven approach to task management and scheduling. Today, young people are busier than ever with school, organizations, and recreation, so they struggle to manage their time properly. The most diligent of young people handle their time management by hand, but Tim leverages technology to automatically manage your time for you so you never miss a deadline. By minimizing context switching as you go about your day,  Tim provides a comprehensive look at your schedule to help you make the most out of your time. 
	
  Tim will provide an easily accessible tool for more advanced control of the User’s time and productivity. Currently, time management solutions fail to leverage the benefits of technology through optimization and active management and those burdens fall heavily on the user and discourage use. We will use Scrum project management and agile methodologies to create a solution and deliver a software package to project stakeholders.
  
  Tim is a event and task scheduling application that automatically manages the user’s time and keeps track of individual task status and completion. Tim will be a cross-platform desktop application running on Electron that enables users to add their personal calendar event information and then keep a running list of assignments, work items, chores, or general obligations the user needs to complete. Using deadlines, priorities, and sub-tasks created by the user, Tim will schedule the tasks around the user’s blocking calendar events such as class, work, or practice. Then, Tim will fill the user’s google calendar with the tasks by looking at the time the user has free to complete them. As the user completes or adds additional tasks, Tim will recalculate the schedule for the user and attempt to keep groups of related tasks together in an effort to reduce the need for the user to context switch throughout the day.
